    <h3>Q1. Difference between div and span tag?</h3>
    <p>
        The &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags are both HTML tags that are used to group content, but they are used in different ways.  <br>
        The &lt;div&gt; tag is used to group larger sections of content together, often to apply styles or scripts to them as a group. &lt;div> is a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width of its parent container by default and creates a line break before and after the element. <br>
        the &lt;span&gt; tag is used to group smaller sections of content together, often to apply styles or scripts to specific words or phrases. For example, you might use a &lt;span&gt;tag to apply a different color or font size to a specific word within a sentence.&lt;span&gt; is an inline-level element, which means it only takes up as much space as necessary to display its content and does not create a line break before or after the element.

    <h3>Q2. Difference between class and IDs?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The class attribute is used to group elements together that share a common style or function, while the id attribute is used to uniquely identify a specific element on a page.</li>
        <li>Multiple elements can have the same class, but each element can only have one id and it must be unique on the page.</li>
        <li>Styles can be applied to all elements with a specific class at once, while styles can be applied to a specific element with an id</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Q3. What are self closing tags?</h3>
    <p>
        Self-closing tags are HTML tags that don't require a separate closing tag because they don't have any content inside them. Instead, they are closed with a forward slash (/) at the end of the opening tag. <br>
        <b>Ex. â€“</b> br, input, img, hr, meta etc

    <h3>Q4. How many types of headings are there ? How to decide which to use where?</h3>
    <p>
        In HTML, there are six levels of headings, from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;. Here's a quick summary of each level:
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;h1&gt; is the highest level of heading and is typically used for the main title of a page.</li>
                <li>&lt;h2&gt; is used for major headings within the page, such as section titles.</li>
                <li>&lt;h3&gt; is used for subheadings within the page, such as subsection titles.</li>
                <li>&lt;h4&gt; is used for headings within subheadings, and so on.</li>
                <li>&lt;h5&gt; and &lt;h6&gt; are used for headings at even lower levels of hierarchy, but they are less commonly used.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Q5. Difference between block and inline?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Block-level elements create a block of content on the page, while inline-level elements flow within a block-level element. Examples of block-level elements include &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, and &lt;li&gt;. Each block-level element starts on a new line.</li>
        <li>Block-level elements take up the full width available to them, while inline-level elements take up only as much space as necessary to display their content. Examples of inline-level elements include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;img&gt;.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Q6. Difference between em and strong?</h3>
    <p>
        The strong element represents strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.<br>
        It typically bolds the text to make it stand out.<br>
        The &lt;em&gt; tag is used to indicate emphasis(tilt) on a piece of text. It typically italicizes the text to make it stand out from the surrounding text.
        Both helps in SEO.

    <h3>Q7. What are attributes?</h3>
    <p>
        Attributes in HTML are additional properties that can be added to HTML elements to provide more information about the element. Attributes are used to customize and control the behavior of HTML elements. <br>
        Attributes are always included within the opening tag of an element and consist of two parts: the attribute name and the attribute value. The attribute name specifies the type of information being provided, while the attribute value provides the actual information. The attribute value is enclosed within quotation marks. <br>
        Some common HTML attributes include src, alt, class, id, style, title, width, height, name, type, and value.
    </p>

    <h3>Q8. Difference between HTML tags and elements?</h3>
    <p>
        A tag refers to the opening and closing brackets, or angle brackets, used to define an HTML element. For example, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are tags used to define the paragraph element in HTML. <br>
        An element, on the other hand, refers to the entire construct between the opening and closing tags, including any content, attributes, or nested elements. For example, &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; is a paragraph element that consists of the opening tag &lt;p&gt;, the content "This is a paragraph.", and the closing tag &lt;/p&gt;.
